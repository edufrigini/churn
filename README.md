# Predicting Customer Churn in Carriers from Telecom
Customer Churn (or Customer Turnover, in a free translation)
refers to a decision taken by the client on the termination of the business relationship. It also refers to the loss of customers. Customer loyalty and customer turnover always add up to 100%. If a company has a loyalty rate of 60%, then the customer loss rate is 40%. According to the 80/20 customer profitability rule, 20% of customers are generating 80% of revenue. Therefore, it is very important to predict users who are likely to abandon the business relationship and the factors that affect customer decisions.
In this project, you should predict Customer Churn in a Telecom Operator.
The training and test datasets will be provided for you as an attachment to this project. Your job is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a customer can cancel their plan and how likely it is to do so. The dataset header is a description of the type of information in each column.
Using Python language, we recommend you create a
Logistic Regression, to extract the information if a customer will cancel their plan (Yes or No) and the likelihood of one option or another.
